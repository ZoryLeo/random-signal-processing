# random-signal-processing
This project involves simulating and analyzing the transmission of random signals using Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK). It includes noise characterization, adaptive filtering for detection, and Auto-Regressive modeling for signal restoration. The goal is to estimate statistical properties, implement filters, and restore signals efficiently
